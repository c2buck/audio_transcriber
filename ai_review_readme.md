## Overview

The AI review system analyzes transcribed audio content to identify relevant information, particularly for crime investigations. It processes transcripts segment-by-segment, applying contextual understanding to highlight important sections with precise timestamp references.

Key benefits:
- **Privacy-First**: All AI analysis runs locally on your machine
- **Contextual Analysis**: AI considers case-specific facts and requirements
- **Timestamp Navigation**: Direct links to specific moments in recordings
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed analysis reports

## Setup Requirements

1. **Install Ollama**
   - Windows: Download and install from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
   - macOS: `brew install ollama`
   - Linux: `curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh`

2. **Download AI Model**
   - Start Ollama service (usually automatic after installation)
   - Download a compatible model: `ollama pull llama2` (or other models)
   - Verify installation: `ollama list`

3. **System Requirements**
   - Minimum 8GB RAM (16GB+ recommended)
   - SSD storage recommended
   - CPU-only operation is supported, but GPU acceleration improves performance

## Core Capabilities

### Local Processing
- All AI analysis runs on your machine via Ollama
- No data sent to external services, ensuring complete privacy
- Supports various AI models (Llama, CodeLlama, Mistral, etc.)

### Contextual Analysis
- AI considers case facts and specific requirements
- Identifies content relevant to investigations
- Understands context across multiple recordings

### Segment-by-Segment Review
- Detailed analysis of individual transcript segments
- Maintains context between segments
- Processes each recording independently

### Flexible Models
- Compatible with various Ollama models
- Adapts to different language models and capabilities
- Allows selection based on performance needs

### Progress Tracking
- Real-time progress updates during analysis
- Detailed logging of AI interactions
- Comprehensive status reporting

## Usage Workflow

1. **Complete Transcription**
   - First transcribe your audio files using the main transcription feature
   - Ensure you have a combined transcript file

2. **Switch to AI Review Tab**
   - Navigate to the "ðŸ¤– AI Review" tab in the application

3. **Load Transcript**
   - Click "Browse" to select the combined transcript file
   - The app will parse segments for analysis
   - View segment information in the interface

4. **Configure Analysis**
   - Enter case facts or specific analysis requirements in the text area
   - Select your preferred AI model from the dropdown
   - Adjust any additional settings if available

5. **Start Review**
   - Click "Start AI Review" to begin analysis
   - Monitor progress as each segment is analyzed
   - View detailed logs in the logging area

6. **Review Results**
   - When complete, examine the analysis results
   - Open generated reports for comprehensive review
   - Use timestamp links to navigate to specific audio sections

## Enhanced Crime Investigation Features

The AI review feature has been specially enhanced for crime investigation scenarios:

### Crime-Relevant Section Detection
- **Intelligent Analysis**: AI specifically looks for content relevant to crime investigations including:
  - Direct evidence related to the crime
  - Witness statements and observations
  - Suspect behavior and statements
  - Timeline information
  - Physical evidence descriptions
  - Names, locations, and identifying details
  - Contradictions or inconsistencies
  - Suspicious activities

### Timestamp-Based Navigation
- **Precise Timing**: Each relevant section includes estimated timestamps
- **Direct Audio Links**: Click-able links that jump directly to specific moments in recordings
- **Time Ranges**: Clear start and end times for each relevant section

### Crime Investigation Report
- **Dedicated HTML Report**: Automatically generates a crime-focused investigation report
- **Audio Integration**: Direct links to play audio from specific timestamps
- **Organized by Recording**: Sections grouped by source recording for easy reference
- **Visual Highlighting**: Crime-relevant content clearly marked and formatted

## Output Files

When running AI analysis, three types of reports are generated:

1. **Individual Analysis Files** (`.ai.txt`): Detailed analysis for each recording
2. **Combined Summary** (`ai_review_summary_[timestamp].txt`): Complete analysis of all recordings
3. **Crime Investigation Report** (`crime_investigation_report_[timestamp].html`): Enhanced HTML report with:
   - Quick navigation to relevant audio sections
   - Timestamp-based audio links
   - Visual crime-relevant content highlighting
   - Executive summary of findings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Ollama connection failed"**
- Ensure Ollama is installed and running (`ollama serve`)
- Check that the Ollama service is accessible at `http://localhost:11434`
- Verify you have downloaded at least one AI model (`ollama list`)
- Check firewall settings if connection issues persist

**Slow Analysis Performance**
- Try using a smaller/faster AI model
- Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements
- Close other resource-intensive applications
- Consider GPU acceleration if available

**Out of Memory Errors**
- Try using a smaller AI model
- Reduce batch size or segment length
- Increase system swap space
- Upgrade RAM if possible

**Missing Timestamps in Reports**
- Ensure original transcripts contain timestamp information
- Use JSON-formatted transcripts for enhanced timestamp accuracy
- Check that audio files are properly linked

### Performance Tips

1. **Model Selection**: Choose smaller models for faster analysis, larger models for better accuracy
2. **GPU Acceleration**: If available, ensure Ollama is configured to use GPU
3. **Batch Processing**: Process manageable batches of recordings
4. **JSON Transcripts**: Use JSON-formatted transcripts for enhanced timestamp accuracy
5. **Detailed Case Facts**: Provide comprehensive case facts for better relevance detection

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The AI Review system consists of several key components:

- **AIReviewManager**: Core class managing the analysis process
- **TranscriptSegment**: Represents a single recording segment
- **CrimeRelevantSection**: Represents a section relevant to investigation
