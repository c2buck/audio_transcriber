## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- FFmpeg (required for audio processing)

### Install FFmpeg
**Windows:**
```bash
# Using chocolatey
choco install ffmpeg

# Using winget
winget install FFmpeg
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg  # Ubuntu/Debian
sudo yum install ffmpeg  # CentOS/RHEL
```

### Install Python Dependencies
```bash
# Clone or download the project
cd transcriber_app

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

1. **Launch the Application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Select Input Folder**
   - Click "Browse..." next to "Input Folder"
   - Choose a folder containing your audio files
   - The app will automatically scan for supported formats

3. **Select Output Folder**
   - Click "Browse..." next to "Output Folder"
   - Choose where you want the transcriptions saved

4. **Choose Whisper Model**
   - Select from the dropdown: tiny, base, small, medium, or large
   - Larger models are more accurate but slower

5. **Start Transcription**
   - Click "Start Transcription"
   - Monitor progress in real-time
   - View logs for detailed information

6. **View Results**
   - Individual .txt files are saved for each audio file
   - Click "Open HTML Report" to view the comprehensive report
   - HTML report includes hyperlinks to play original audio files

## Whisper Model Comparison

| Model  | Size | Speed | Accuracy | Use Case |

## GPU Support

The application automatically detects and uses the best available compute device:

- **NVIDIA GPU**: CUDA support for faster processing
- **Apple Silicon**: MPS backend for M1/M2 Macs
- **CPU**: Fallback for universal compatibility

Device information is displayed in the "Device Information" section of the interface.

## HTML Report Features

The generated HTML report includes:
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Total files, success/failure counts, processing time
- **File Listings**: Each transcription with metadata
- **Audio Playback Links**: Click to play original files directly
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile browsers
- **Professional Styling**: Clean, modern appearance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No module named 'whisper'"**
```bash
pip install openai-whisper
```

**"FFmpeg not found"**
- Install FFmpeg using instructions above
- Ensure FFmpeg is in your system PATH

**"CUDA out of memory"**
- Try a smaller model (tiny, base, or small)
- Close other GPU-intensive applications
- The app will automatically fall back to CPU if needed

**"Permission denied" errors**
- Ensure you have write permissions to the output folder
- Try running as administrator (Windows) or with sudo (Linux/Mac)

### Performance Tips

1. **Use GPU**: Install CUDA for NVIDIA GPUs for significant speed improvements
2. **Choose Right Model**: Balance speed vs accuracy based on your needs
3. **Close Other Apps**: Free up system resources for better performance
4. **SSD Storage**: Use SSD drives for faster file I/O
